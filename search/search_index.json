// Switch to frames driver.switchTo().frame(1);driver.switchTo().frame(\"frameName\"); WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id(\"id\")); driver.switchTo().frame(element); // Switch to the default document driver.switchTo().defaultContent(); Advanced Browser Configurations // Set a HTTP proxy Chromevar proxy = new Proxy(); proxy.setProxyType(Proxy.ProxyType.MANUAL); proxy.setAutodetect(false); proxy.setSslProxy(\"127.0.0.1:3239\"); ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.setProxy(proxy); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); // Accept all certificates ChromeChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"--ignore-certificate-errors\"); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); // Set Chrome options ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"user-data-dir=C:PathToUser Data\"); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); // Set the default page load timeout driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // Start Chrome with an unpacked extension ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"load-extension=/path/to/extension\"); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); // Start Chrome with a packed extension ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.addExtensions(new File(\"local/path/to/extension.crx\")); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); Taking a Screenshot You can use the following method to take a full-screen screenshot of the browser. public void takeFullScreenshot(String fileName) throws Exception { File srcFile = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); String tempDir = getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\"); File destFile = new File(Paths.get(tempDir, fileName + \".png\").toString()); FileUtils.getFileUtils().copyFile(srcFile, destFile); } Sometimes you may need to take a screenshot of a single element. public void takeScreenshotOfElement(WebElement element, String fileName) throws Exception { File screenshotFile = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); BufferedImage fullImg = ImageIO.read(screenshotFile); Point point = element.getLocation(); int elementWidth = element.getSize().getWidth(); int elementHeight = element.getSize().getHeight(); BufferedImage eleScreenshot = fullImg.getSubimage(point.getX(), point.getY(), elementWidth, elementHeight); ImageIO.write(eleScreenshot, \"png\", screenshotFile); String tempDir = getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\"); File destFile = new File(Paths.get(tempDir, fileName + \".png\").toString()); FileUtils.getFileUtils().copyFile(screenshotFile, destFile); } First, we make a full-screen screenshot then we locate the specified element by its location and size attributes. After that, the found rectangle chunk is saved as a BufferedImage. Here is how you use both methods in tests: @Test public void takeFullScreenshot_test() throws Exception { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com\"); takeFullScreenshot(\"testImage\"); } @Test public void takeElementScreenshot_test() throws Exception { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com\"); var element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(\"/html/body/div[1]/header/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/nav\"))); takeScreenshotOfElement(element, \"testElementImage\"); } Get HTML Source of WebElement You can use the getAttribute method of the WebElement interface to get the inner HTML of a specific element. @Test public void getHtmlSourceOfWebElement() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com\"); var element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated( By.xpath(\"/html/body/div[1]/header/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/nav\"))); String sourceHtml = element.getAttribute(\"innerHTML\"); System.out.println(sourceHtml); } Execute JavaScript You can use the interface JavaScriptExecutor to execute JavaScript through WebDriver. @Test public void executeJavaScript() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com\"); JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver; String title = (String) javascriptExecutor.executeScript(\"return document.title\"); System.out.println(title); } This test will take the current window's title via JavaScript and print it to the output window. Set Page Load Timeoout There are at least three methods that you can use for the job. First, you can set the default driver's page load timeout through the WebDriver's options class. driver.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); You can wait until the page is completely loaded via JavaScript. private void waitUntilLoaded() { wait.until(x -> { JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver; String isReady = (String) javascriptExecutor.executeScript(\"return document.readyState\"); return isReady.equals(\"complete\"); }); } Your third option is to wait for a specific element(s) to be visible on the page. wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfAllElements( driver.findElements(By.xpath(\"//*[@id='tve_editor']/div[2]/div[2]/div/div\")))); Execute Tests in a Headless Browser You can use the ChromeOptions class and set a few arguments to set up Chrome to run without its UI in the so-called headless mode. You can do the same for Firefox and Edge Chromium. ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.addArguments( \"--headless\", \"--disable-gpu\", \"--window-size=1920,1200\", \"--ignore-certificate-errors\"); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); Check If an Element Is Visible You can use the isDisplayed method of the WebElement interface. @Test public void checkIfElementIsVisible() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com\"); var element = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"/html/body/div[1]/header/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/nav\"); Assert.assertTrue(element).isDisplayed()); } Manage Cookies Before you can work with the cookies of a site, you need to navigate to some of its pages. @Test public void manageCookies() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com\"); // get all cookies var cookies = driver.manage().getCookies(); for (Cookie cookie:cookies) { System.out.println(cookie.getName()); } // get a cookie by name var fbPixelCookie = driver.manage().getCookieNamed(\"_fbp\"); // create a new cookie by name Cookie newCookie = new Cookie(\"customName\", \"customValue\"); driver.manage().addCookie(newCookie); // delete a cookie driver.manage().deleteCookie(fbPixelCookie); // delete a cookie by name driver.manage().deleteCookieNamed(\"customName\"); // delete all cookies driver.manage().deleteAllCookies(); } Maximize Window Use the maximize method of the Window interface. driver.manage().window().maximize(); Drag and Drop You can use the special Actions WebDriver class to perform complex UI interactions. Through its method dragAndDropBy, you can drag and drop. You only need to set the desired X and Y offsets. @Test public void dragAndDrop() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/\"); var element = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//*[@id='project']/p[1]/div/div[2]\")); Actions action = new Actions(driver); action.dragAndDropBy(element, 30, 0).build().perform(); } Upload a File It is a straightforward task to upload a file using WebDriver. You need to locate the file element and use the WebElement's sendKeys method to set the path to your file. @Test public void fileUpload() throws IOException { driver.navigate().to( \"https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/ajaxpanel/application-scenarios/file-upload/defaultcs.aspx\"); var element = driver.findElement(By.id(\"ctl00_ContentPlaceholder1_RadUpload1file0\")); String filePath = Paths.get(getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\"), \"debugWebDriver.xml\").toString(); File destFile = new File(filePath); destFile.createNewFile(); element.sendKeys(filePath); } Handle JavaScript Pop-ups You can use the accept and dismiss methods of the Alert interface to handle JavaScript pop-ups. First, you need to use the switchTo method to switch to the alert. @Test public void handleJavaScripPopUps() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_confirm\"); driver.switchTo().frame(\"iframeResult\"); var button = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"/html/body/button\")); button.click(); Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert(); if (alert.getText().equals(\"Press a button!\")) { alert.accept(); } else { alert.dismiss(); } } Switch Between Browser Windows or Tabs WebDriver drives the browser within a scope of one browser window. However, we can use its switchTo method to change the target window or tab. @Test public void movingBetweenTabs() { driver.navigate().to(\"https://www.automatetheplanet.com/\"); var firstLink = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//*[@id='menu-item-11362']/a\")); var secondLink = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//*[@id='menu-item-6']/a\")); String selectLinkOpenninNewTab = Keys.chord(Keys.CONTROL,Keys.RETURN); firstLink.sendKeys(selectLinkOpenninNewTab); secondLink.sendKeys(selectLinkOpenninNewTab); Set<String> windows = driver.getWindowHandles(); String firstTab = (String)windows.toArray()[1]; String lastTab = (String)windows.toArray()[2]; driver.switchTo().window(lastTab); Assert.assertEquals(\"Resources - Automate The Planet\", driver.getTitle()); driver.switchTo().window(firstTab); Assert.assertEquals(\"Blog - Automate The Planet\", driver.getTitle()); } The getWindowHandles method returns all open browser windows. You can pass the name of the desired tab/window to the window method of the TargetLocator interface (returned by the switchTo method) to change the current target. You can also notice that we use one more trick to open the link in a new tab using the Keys.chord method, and then instead of clicking, we use the sendKeys method to perform CTRL + return sequence. Navigation History WebDriver Navigation interface contains handy methods for going forward and backward. Also, you can refresh the current page. @Test public void navigationHistory() { driver.navigate().to(\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1078541/Advanced-WebDriver-Tips-and-Tricks-Part\"); driver.navigate().to(\"http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1017816/Speed-up-Selenium-Tests-through-RAM-Facts-and-Myth\"); driver.navigate().back(); Assert.assertEquals(\"10 Advanced WebDriver Tips and Tricks - Part 1 - CodeProject\", driver.getTitle()); driver.navigate().refresh(); Assert.assertEquals(\"10 Advanced WebDriver Tips and Tricks - Part 1 - CodeProject\", driver.getTitle()); driver.navigate().forward(); Assert.assertEquals(\"Speed up Selenium Tests through RAM Facts and Myths - CodeProject\", driver.getTitle()); } Handle SSL Certificate Error ChromeDriver ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"--ignore-certificate-errors\"); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); Scroll Focus to Control There isn't a built-in mechanism in WebDriver to scroll focus to a control. However, you can use the JavaScript's method window.scroll. You only need to pass the getY location of the desired element. @Test public void scrollFocusToControl() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com/\"); var ourMissionLink = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//*[@id=\"panel-6435-0-0-4\"]/div\")); String jsToBeExecuted = String.format(\"window.scroll(0, {0});\", ourMissionLink.getLocation().getY()); JavascriptExecutor javascriptExecutor = (JavascriptExecutor) driver; javascriptExecutor.executeScript(jsToBeExecuted); } Focus on a Control To do the trick, we use again the special Actions class, which has a method called moveToElement. @Test public void focusOnControl() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://automatetheplanet.com/\"); waitUntilLoaded(); var ourMissionLink = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//*[@id=\"panel-6435-0-0-4\"]/div\")); Actions action = new Actions(driver); action.moveToElement(ourMissionLink).build().perform(); } Set HTTP Proxy ChromeDriver The configuration of a proxy for ChromeDriver is a little bit different from the one for FirefoxDriver. You need to use the special Proxy class in combination with ChromeOptions. var proxy = new Proxy(); proxy.setProxyType(Proxy.ProxyType.MANUAL); proxy.setAutodetect(false); proxy.setSslProxy(\"127.0.0.1:3239\"); ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.setProxy(proxy); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); Set HTTP Proxy with Authentication ChromeDriver The only difference from the previous example is the configuration of the --proxy-server argument. var proxy = new Proxy(); proxy.setProxyType(Proxy.ProxyType.MANUAL); proxy.setAutodetect(false); proxy.setSslProxy(\"127.0.0.1:3239\"); ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.setProxy(proxy); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"--proxy-server=http://user:password@127.0.0.1:3239\"); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); Start ChromeDriver with an Unpacked Extension Chrome extensions can be either packed or unpacked. Packed extensions are a single file with a .crx extension. Unpacked Extensions are a directory containing the extension, including a manifest.json file. To load an unpacked extension you need to set the load-extension argument. chromeOptions.addArguments(\"load-extension=/pathTo/extension\"); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); Start ChromeDriver with an Packed Extension Instead of setting the load-extension argument, you need to use the addExtension method of the ChromeOptions class to set the path to your packed extension. ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions(); chromeOptions.addExtensions(new File(\"local/path/to/extension.crx\")); driver = new ChromeDriver(chromeOptions); Assert a Button Enabled or Disabled You can check if an element is disabled through the isEnabled method of the WebElement interface. @Test public void assertButtonEnabledDisabled() { driver.navigate().to(\"http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_button_disabled\"); driver.switchTo().frame(\"iframeResult\"); var button = driver.findElement(By.xpath(\"/html/body/button\")); Assert.assertFalse(button.isEnabled()); } Verify File Downloaded ChromeDriver To change the default download directory of the current Chrome instance set the download.default_directory argument. When we initiate the file download, we use the WebDriverWait to wait until the file exists on the file system. Finally, we assert the file size. The whole code is surrounded with a try-finally block. In the finally we delete the downloaded file so that our test to be consistent every time. String downloadFilepath = \"c:temp\"; HashMap<String, Object> chromePrefs = new HashMap<>(); chromePrefs.put(\"profile.default_content_settings.popups\", 0); chromePrefs.put(\"download.default_directory\", downloadFilepath); chromeOptions.setExperimentalOption(\"prefs\", chromePrefs); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"--test-type\"); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"start-maximized\", \"disable-popup-blocking\"); String downloadFilepath = \"c:temp\"; HashMap<String, Object> chromePrefs = new HashMap<>(); chromePrefs.put(\"profile.default_content_settings.popups\", 0); chromePrefs.put(\"download.default_directory\", downloadFilepath); chromeOptions.setExperimentalOption(\"prefs\", chromePrefs); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"--test-type\"); chromeOptions.addArguments(\"start-maximized\", \"disable-popup-blocking\"); @Test public void VerifyFileDownloadChrome() throws IOException { var expectedFilePath = Paths.get(\"c:tempTesting_Framework_2015_3_1314_2_Free.exe\"); try { driver.navigate().to(\"https://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file/v2/telerik-testing-framework\"); wait.until(x -> Files.exists(expectedFilePath)); long bytes = Files.size(expectedFilePath); Assert.assertEquals(4326192, bytes);

Additional Details Fixtures are external pieces of static data that can be used by your tests. We should not hard code data in the test case. It should drive from an external source like CSV, HTML, or JSON. They will be majorly used with the cy.fixture() command when you need to stub the network calls. Integration folder provides a place that writes out test cases. It also provides an \u201cexamples\u201d directory, which contains the default test cases provided by Cypress and can be used to add new test cases also. We can also create our folder under the integration directory and add out test cases under that. Plugins contain the plugins or listeners. By default, Cypress will automatically include the plugins file \u201ccypress/plugins/index.js\u201d before every test it runs. You can programmatically alter the resolved configuration and environment variables using plugins, Eg. If we have to inject customized options to browsers like accepting the certificate, or do any activity on test case pass or fail or to handle any other events like handling screenshots. They enable you to extend or modify the existing behavior of Cypress. Support writes customized commands or reusable methods that are available for usage in all of your spec/test files. This file runs before every single spec file. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have to import this file in every single one of your spec files. The \u201csupport\u201d file is a great place to put reusable behavior such as Custom Commands or global overrides that you want to be applied and available to all of your spec files. Node_Modules in the default project structure is the heart of the cypress project. All the node packages will be installed in the node_modules directory and will be available in all the test files. So, in a nutshell, this is the folder where NPM installs all the project dependencies. Cypress.json is used to store different configurations. E.g., timeout, base URL, test files, or any other configuration that we want to override for tweaking the behavior of Cypress. We can also manage the customized folder structure because it is part of by default Cypress Configurations. 07.

Benefit of the code review process is the collective team\u2019s improved coding skills. Code review is a very important phenomenon in the SOFTWARE development process. Made popular by the open-source community, it is now the standard for any team of developers. If it is executed correctly, the benefit is not only in reducing the number of bugs and better code quality but also in the training effect for the programmer. Code review is critical for the following reasons: Ensure that you have no bugs in the code. Minimize your chances of having issues. Confirm new code adheres to guidelines. Increase the efficiency of the new code. Code reviews further lead to improving other team members' expertise. As a senior developer typically conducts a code review, a junior developer may use this feedback to improve their own coding. Code review levels Typos and problems with styles (this is the first thing that catches the eye with a cursory code review). This item should be excluded from the code review process using automation. Problems with names, functions, classes, folders, and files. The location of the code in the project i.e. whether this function is located in the desired file, class. Whether this class is located in the right folder in the right place in your project. And whether this code is necessary at all. Perhaps this function is already implemented, but people just do not know about its existence. It may be much better to use some well-known library that solves this problem instead of writing this new code. Algorithms and approaches. Reviewed as a principle your approach fits into the system. Criticize the selected algorithm or approach. They are trying to understand a more general picture of what is happening. Shortcomings - pay attention to during code review No Proof of Success. The automation scripts need to run successfully in order to pass review, and proof of success (such as a log or a screenshot) must be attached to the review. Typos and Bad Formatting. Typos and bad formatting reflect carelessness, cause frustration, and damage reputation. They are especially bad for Behavior-Driven Development frameworks. Hard-Coded Values. Hard-coded values often indicate hasty development. Sometimes, they aren\u2019t a big problem, but they can cripple an automation code base\u2019s flexibility. Incorrect Test Coverage. It is surprisingly common to see an automation script that doesn\u2019t actually cover the intended test steps. A step from the test procedure may be missing, or an assertion may yield a false positive. Sometimes, assertions may not even be performed! When reviewing tests, keep the original test procedure handy, and watch out for missing coverage. Unclear Comments. Leaving unclear comments to the author for any changes needed is the most reviewers make. It is necessary to put in clear comments to create space for dialogue. Poor Code Placement. Automation projects tend to grow fast. Along with new tests, new shared code like page objects and data models are added all the time. Maintaining a good, organized structure is necessary for project scalability and teamwork. Test cases should be organized by feature area. Common code should be abstracted from test cases and put into shared libraries. Framework-level code for things like inputs and logging should be separated from test-level code. If the code is put in the wrong place, it could be difficult to find or reuse. It could also create a dependency nightmare. For example, non-web tests should not have a dependency on Selenium WebDriver. Make sure the new code is put in the right place. Bad Config Changes. As a general rule, submit any config changes in a separate code review from other changes, and provide a thorough explanation to the reviewers for why the change is needed. Brittleness. Here are a few examples of brittleness to watch out for in review: Do test cases have adequate cleanup routines, even when they crash? Are all exceptions handled properly, even unexpected ones? Is Selenium WebDriver always disposed of? Will SSH connections be automatically reconnected if dropped? Are XPaths too loose or too strict? Is a REST API response code of 201 just as good as 200? Ignoring Design. Many reviewers ignore the overall design and just focus on the functionality and workability of the automation script. But by doing this, they miss the role of the automation script in the whole system and how it fits into what is already there. Duplication is the biggest problem for test automation. Many testing operations are inherently repetitive. Engineers sometimes just copy-paste code blocks, rather than seek existing methods or add new helpers, to save development time. Plus, it can be difficult to find reusable parts that meet immediate needs in a large codebase. Nevertheless, good code reviews should catch code redundancy and suggest better solutions. Conclusion The code review stage is highly underestimated in the testing and quality assurance process. If you are a tester who works within the framework of iterative development, familiarization with pull requests should be an integral part of your work after familiarization with the requirements. On the other hand, your code should also be viewed by other team members, which is a key factor in mastering test automation.","title":"Code Review"},{"location":"pages/qa-box/qa_code_review/#qa-box-code-review","text":"The primary goal of the code review process is to assess any new code for bugs, errors, and quality standards set by the organization.

With software being rolled out faster to meet ever-increasing customer demands and competition, test automation will continue to be on the rise. Testing early and fast helps identify bugs faster, saves time, effort and costs to a large extent. I have come across and followed some useful coding guidelines which I feel every QA automation tester should follow during test automation script creation. Hope you people find it helpful. Programming Follow Programming Language Guidelines (method name-getPayload(), class name- APIEndpoints, package name-com.testingsumo.backend.tests, variable name-authToken) Follow Oops Concepts Wherever Possible - Abstraction(base classes), Inheritance(multiple implementations of same things/multiple inheritances), Polymorphism(many forms with something different), Data Hiding(hide unnecessary/sensitive info), Encapsulation(Bind small entities into a single large entity) Write clean code Keep it simple. Always look over your code and ask yourself if there's a simpler way of doing what it is that you are trying to do. Sometimes the obvious solution to a testing problem only becomes clear after you have solved it in a complicated way; now it's time to go back and solve it more elegantly. Don't repeat yourself. If there's something you're doing in more than one test - for example, logging in to the application - write a method that you can call instead of putting those steps into every test. Similarly, create a file where you save all of your variables and element locators, and have all of your tests refer to that file. That way if a variable or a locator changes, you can make the change in one place rather than several. Be consistent. Consistent code is easier to read. Be consistent with your casing: if you have a variable for the user's first name called \u201cfirstName\u201d, don't make the variable for the user's last name \"LastName\". Follow the conventions that your developers are using: if they indent with two spaces, you should too. If they put their opening curly braces on a separate line, you should as well. Comment your code. It's not always obvious what test automation code is doing at first glance, and while you might be quite used to the syntax you are using for your tests, your developers might not be familiar with it. Simple comments like \"Polling the queue for the delete request\" can be really helpful in explaining your intent. Moreover, what might seem really obvious to you now might not be obvious in three months when you need to update the test! Your future self will thank you for the comments you write today. Reduce code duplication (think before writing new code, can I use/make changes in existing code?) Increase code reusability Make your code generic wherever possible Leave no hardcoded data in source code Keep your static data outside the source code Keep your dynamic data dynamic in test code (fetch it from DB queries or scripts) Test your code properly, use IDE options such as call hierarchy or show usage to test your changes end 2 end Framework and Debugging Use Extensive logging- everything which is part of source code should be analyzed from logs without looking at the source code Generate and save failure proofs outside the src code- videos/data/screenshots/logs Focus on making your code scalable and faster without compromising the code quality Your code should be platform and system independent Use as many assertions as possible focus on automated testing rather than automation Leave no hardcoded data in source code Always think for the future, separate out tech dependencies so that migration to new tech is easy in case it is needed Keep your tests independent for better results in multithreading unless they are related (for example publisher-subscriber related tests) Use Proper Documentation Create code that can be easily read and modified by others","title":"Coding Guidelines"},{"location":"pages/qa-box/qa_coding_guidelines/#qa-box-coding-guidelines","text":"Automated testing is no longer an option, it\u2019s a must-have in every tester\u2019s bag of tricks.

Naming Conventions File names should be in lower case and each word separated by _ . The name should self explanatory. e.g project_test_login.spec.js , or if using Python project_test_login.py Data / Document files : Camelcase and name should self explanatory. e.g Project_Automation_README.do , or Project_Automation_README.md Class names should follow the UpperCaseCamelCase convention. e.g. class LowLevelLib , or BaseClass , LoginStepDefinitions Variable names should be in lower case and should be self explanatory e.g single_textbox_question , or standard_user Function names should start with lowercase word and then Camelcase should be followed. It should be self explanatory e.g. fillQuestionAndAnswer , or clickOnLoginButton 02. Project Organization Organize your tests - separate and categorize them Create folders to more accurately categorize files Split tests by category, e.g. in the 'user' folder put tests for login and registration, and in the 'shopping' folder - tests for the buying process. Write independent tests You should be able to choose any test or run several tests in any order and still get the same result. Set base URL Instead of repeating the lines with web addresses in each test, set the base URL in the cypress.json file, or if using Selenium, method setDriver within src\\main\\java\\package_directory\\BaseClass . Run tests, that are crucial at the moment if Cypres user: use cy.only and cy.skip , if Python Selenium user: Need to \"Debug\" script to the desired point that determined previously Use your own custom commands, and page objects Add your command to the commands.js file Use the best selectors like CSS , By ID , By ClassName , xPath (In Selenium and Python Only) Add assertions - to be sure that you are referring to the right element at the right time instead of \"static\" wait(ms). Using Cypress: should('contain.text', 'Login') Using Cypress: should('be.visible') Using Selenium, Python: self.applicant_acc_settings.profile_picture.is_present() Don't forget to stretch in between the tests 03. Coding Standards Quotes: Use single-quotes for string literals, e.g. 'my-identifier' , but use double-quotes for strings that are likely to contain single-quote characters as part of the string itself (such as error messages, or any strings containing natural language), e.g. \"You've got an error!\" . For triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be consistent with the docstring convention in PEP 257. Imports grouping: Should be grouped in the following order (Python Selenium Only) standard library imports related third party imports local application/library specific imports Import code: You should put a blank line between each group of imports. Don\u2019t use joker from module import * . Instead list the names you need explicitly: from module import name1, name2 . Examples: Cypress: import { onNavigations } from \"../../../support.page_obejcts/navigations\" Selenium, Python: from project.page_objects.registration.welcome_page import WelcomePage Consistent Indentation: (Python Only) Spaces are the preferred indentation method. Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs. Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively. When invoking the Python 2 command line interpreter with the -t option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes tabs and spaces. When using -tt these warnings become errors. These options are highly recommended! Avoid Obvious Comments: Commenting your code is fantastic; however, it can be overdone or just be plain redundant. Take this example: # get the country code country_code = get_country_code(remote_address) # if country code is US if country_code == 'US': // display the form input for state form_input_state() When the text is that obvious, it's really not productive to repeat it within comments. If you must comment on that code, you can simply combine it to a single line instead: # display state selection for US users country_code = get_country_code(remote_address) If country_code == 'US': form_input_state() Code Grouping: More often than not, certain tasks require a few lines of code. It is a good idea to keep these tasks within separate blocks of code, with some spaces between them: # import local application/library from xpath import xpath_list 04. Framework Guidelines Test case data should be kept in separate files. Logs and Reports folder should be maintained. Proper logs should be maintained. Html Reports should be generated. Rerunning of automation scripts should not override the old reports. Proper Exception Handling should be done. Your framework should contain the Readme.md file which explains the execution steps. Setup file should be created which includes all dependencies installation. Virtual environment of python should be done correctly so that all dependencies and packages installed separately. Make sure the objective for your code is clear. That reflects, use meaningful names for your variables, functions, classes, modules, files etc. While doing so, make sure you don't accidentally use the standard function name or module name. (Refer: http://pycogent.org/coding_guidelines.html ). Add proper module, class, function level doc-comments. If possible, include example in doc-comments. Don\u2019t try to put too much code under one function. 200 lines is an absolute maximum \u2013 50 is usually more reasonable. Remove the commented code. If required, it could be brought back by source revisions. Remove any duplicate code if exist. This could be done by moving duplicated code under a function and calling those instead. Check if code could be simpler. Break complex routines down into smaller ones, consider using built-in functions and data types instead of custom ones, see if complex logic can be separated into a dispatch routine and simple individual functions, etc. Make use of existing framework functions/APIs/utility methods instead of writing new. If any improvement on existing framework is possible, do that but get it reviewed prior to commit. Follow the PEP8 guidelines. It's much more easy from the IDE you use. Like for ex: In PyCharm you can convert your code as per PEP8 standards by shortcut Opt+Cmd+L. 05. About HTML Elements Html DOM consists of: HTML Tags, HTML Attributes and Attributes values Class and ID are also HTML attribute names Class attribute can have several values and each value is separated by space HTML tags usually come in pairs of Opening and Closing tag. Closing tag has the same name and forward slash Value in between angle brackets (>here<) is a plain text Elements above the \u201ckey\u201d web element are Parent elemens Elements inside of the \u201ckey\u201d Element are Child Elements Elements placed at the same level side by side are Sibiling Elements Remember to use the best locators (never use absolute XPath or absolute CSS). ID and data attributes are the best for locating elements. 06.

Here\u2019s how I will find out.\" Perfect Testing The infinite process of comparing the invisible to the ambiguous so as to avoid the unthinkable happening to the anonymous. In other words, perfect testing is a challenge. Testing is a complex problem-solving activity. Learning testing on your own doesn\u2019t cost you much, you don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission. However, it\u2019s hard to know if you are doing it well. Good testing varies a lot with the context. Context-Driven Testing Community Principles The value of any practice depends on its context. There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices. People, working together, are the most important part of the any project\u2019s context. Project unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable The product is solution. If the problem isn\u2019t solved, the product doesn\u2019t work. Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process. Only through judgement and skills, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our product. Some Cool Things That Experts Have And Do Experts have: Situational awareness Confidence in confusion Colleague network Trained reflexes Awareness of limitations Diverse (different) experiences Relevant knowledge Mental models for problem solving (Schemata) Reputation Experts do: Avoid traps and dead ends Systematic inquiry Comfort authority and convention Self-training and retraining Self-criticism Pattern matching on experience Coherent methodology Write, speak, teach Situational awareness How to ask questions What kind of project situation are we in? How much time do we have? Who is involved? Who\u2019s on the test team? What kind of deliverable does it have to be? Who\u2019s our customer What information do I have on my desk right now about this problem What informations is available via the various electronic mechanisms Confidence in confusion If I\u2019m confused, I\u2019m confident Colleague network Colleague: I\u2019m not good at all kind of testing. So I call colleague, he/she knows better than I, and he/she will transfer that skill to me Personal Vision Of Testing Expertise I can test anything under any conditions in any time frame I deliver useful results in a usable form I perform at least as well as any other expert would I choose methods that fit the situation I can explain and defend my work on demand I collaborate effectively with the project team I make appropriate use of available tools and resources I advise clients about the risks and limitations of my work I advise clients about how they can help me to do better work I faithfully and ethically serve my clients Rapid Testing Is a mind-set and a skill-set of testing focused on how to do testing more quickly, less expensively, with excellent results. This is general testing methodology. It\u2019s adapts to any kind of project or product. Definition of Rapid Software Testing Evaluate by learning through experiencing, exploring, end experimenting including questioning, modelling, observation, inference, study, etc. Thomas Gray was musing about innocence as he watched school boys playing in a yard. He was thinking, \u201cDon\u2019t break the spell. Let them be blissfully happy kids.\u201d. We, however, are not children. We should not wait until we are sure there is trouble. We must have faith in trouble; assume there is trouble until we can prove there isn\u2019t. This helps us in our projects, in our testing, and it helps keep our families safe. Invest In Testability The success of any tooling strategy depends in large part on how well your technology affords interactions with tools. This is why it pays to build testability into your products. From a tool perspective this means two big things: that your product is controllable by tools via easily scripted interfaces, and that its states and outputs are observable by those tools. For this reason, browser based products tend to be more testable while apps on mobile devices are less testable. Products with standard controls are more testable than products with custom controls. Consider making testability review a part of each iteration, and otherwise install this thought process early in your projects. Any serious attempt to make tooling work must go hand-in-hand with testable engineering.","title":"QA Expert"},{"location":"pages/qa-box/qa_expert/#qa-box-qa-expert","text":"\"All Humans are testers\" - James Bach","title":"[QA Box] QA Expert"},{"location":"pages/qa-box/qa_expert/#level-of-learning","text":"Level 0: \u201cI overcome obliviousness\u201d - I now realize there is something here to learn Level 1: \u201cI overcome intimidation\u201d - I feel I can learn this subject or skill.

This is why it pays to build testability into your products. From a tool perspective this means two big things: that your product is controllable by tools via easily scripted interfaces, and that its states and outputs are observable by those tools. For this reason, browser based products tend to be more testable while apps on mobile devices are less testable. Products with standard controls are more testable than products with custom controls. Consider making testability review a part of each iteration, and otherwise install this thought process early in your projects. Any serious attempt to make tooling work must go hand-in-hand with testable engineering.","title":"Invest In Testability"},{"location":"pages/qa-box/qa_good_practice/","text":"[ QA Box ] Good Automation Practice There are a lot of reasons test automation is beneficial, and by adhering to automated testing best practices you can ensure that your testing strateagy delivers the maximum return on investment (ROI). Automated testing will shorten your development cycles, avoid cumbersome repetitive tasks and help improve software quality but how do you get started? These best practices a successful foundation to start improving your software quality. Thorough testing is crucial to the success of a software product. If your software doesn\u2019t work properly, chances are strong that most people won\u2019t buy or use it\u2026at least not for long. But testing to find defects \u2013 or bugs \u2013 is time-consuming, expensive, often repetitive, and subject to human error. Automated testing, in which Quality Assurance teams use software tools to run detailed, repetitive, and data-intensive tests automatically, helps teams improve software quality and make the most of their always-limited testing resources. Test automation tools help teams test faster, allows them to test substantially more code, improves test accuracy, and frees up QA engineers so they can focus on tests that require manual attention and their unique human skills. Use these top tips to ensure that your software testing is successful and you get the maximum return on investment (ROI): Decide what Test Cases to Automate Repetitive tests that run for multiple builds Tests that tend to cause human error Tests that require multiple data sets. Frequently used functionality that introduces high risk conditions. Tests that are impossible to perform manually. Tests that run on several different hardware or software platforms and configurations. Tests that take a lot of effort and time when manual testing. Success in test automation recipe Careful plan and design work Creating an automation plan (initial set of tests to automate) Define your goal for automated testing Determine which types of tests to automate: Each types of testing has its place in the testing process. Decide what actions your automated tests will perform. Divide your tests into several logical, smaller tests Test the functionality of your application as you add it, rather than waiting until the whole feature is implemented. When creating tests, try to keep them small and focused on one objective Once you create several simple automated tests, you can group your tests into one, larger automated test. You can organize automated tests by the application\u2019s functional area, major/minor division in the application, common functions or a base set of test data. If an automated test refers to other tests, you may need to create a test tree, where you can run tests in a specific order. Select the Right Automated Testing Tool There are a lot of automated testing tools on the market, and it is important to choose the automated testing tool that best suits your overall requirements. Consider these key points when selecting an automated testing tool: Support for your platforms and technology. Are you testing .Net, C# or WPF applications and on what operating systems? Are you going to test web applications? Do you need support for mobile application testing? Do you work with Android or iOS, or do you work with both operating systems? Flexibility for testers of all skill levels. Feature rich but also easy to create automated tests. Does the automated testing tool support record-and-playback test creation as well as manual creation of automated tests; does it include features for implementing checkpoints to verify values, databases, or key functionality of your application? Create automated tests that are reusable, maintainable and resistant to changes in the applications UI. Will my automated tests break if my UI changes? Integrate with your existing ecosystem. Does your tool integrate with your CI/CD pipeline such as Jenkins or Azure DevOps? Or your test management framework such as Zephyr? What about a defect-management system like Jira, or a source control such as Git? Divide your Automated Testing Efforts It is important to identify the level of experience and skills for each of your team members and divide your automated testing efforts accordingly. In order to perform writing automated test scripts, you should have QA engineers that know the script language provided by the automated testing tool. Some team members may not be versed in writing automated test scripts. These QA engineers may be better at writing test cases. Consider using keyword-driven testing. Keyword tests are often seen as an alternative to automated test scripts. Unlike scripts, they can be easily used by technical and non-technical users and allow users of all levels to create robust and powerful automated tests. You should also collaborate on your automated testing project with other QA engineers in your department. Testing performed by a team is more effective for finding defects and the right automated testing tool allows you to share your projects with several testers. Create Good, Quality Test Data The data that should be entered into input fields during an automated test is usually stored in an external file. This data might be read from a database or any other data source like text or XML files, Excel sheets, and database tables. A good automated testing tool actually understands the contents of the data files and iterates over the contents in the automated test. Using external data makes your automated tests reusable and easier to maintain. To add different testing scenarios, the data files can be easily extended with new data without needing to edit the actual automated test. Invest time and effort into creating data that is well structured. The earlier you create good-quality data, the easier it is to extend existing automated tests along with the application's development. Create Automated Tests that are Resistant to Changes in the UI The user interface of the application may change between builds, especially in the early stages. These changes may affect the test results, or your automated tests may no longer work with future versions of the application. Provide unique names for your controls, it makes your automated tests resistant to these UI changes and ensures that your automated tests work without having to make changes to the test itself. Keep Test Records In a Bug Database Using a bug database is a best practice whether a team uses test automation or not. Whenever new bugs are found by the automation tool or by the testers, they should be recorded in a bug tracking tool with the exact steps to reproduce the bugs and other details. Conclusion Adapting these recommended best practices can help you avoid common mistakes and improve your automated testing process.
